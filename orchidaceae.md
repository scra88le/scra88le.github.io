# Taxonomy
Starting with Carl Linnaeus who in 1753 recognized eight genera, the taxonomy of the *Orchidaceae* has evolved continuously during the last 250 years. Whilst there are 50 or so native speices within Britain and Ireland, 36 of which are found within Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire. Worldwide there are thought to be around 28,000 accepted species, distributed across some 900 genera. Orchid taxonomy is still actively being revised and each year approximately 150 new species are discovered.  There are currently five recognised subfamilies:

* *Apostasioideae* - only two genera and 15 species are recognised within what is thought to be the basal lineage of the Orchidaceae
* *Cypripedioideae* - this group is known as the slipper orchids and is split amongst five genera
* *Orchidoideae* - typically single stamen terrestrial plants, with tubers or rhizomes, of around 62 genera and 3200 species
* *Epidendroideae* - the largest subfamily by far, with 576 genera and 15,000 species; most are ephiphytes or parasitic upon mycorrhizal fungi
* *Vanilloideae* - there are 15 genera and around 180 species whose distribution is pantropical, throughout Asia, Australia and the Americas 

All UK species are within the Orchidoideae and Epidendroideae subfamilies, with a single species *Cypripedium calceolus*, commonly known as Lady's Slipper, in the Cypripedioideae family. The type genus for the Orchidaceae family is *Orchis*, which is within the sub-family *Orchidoideae*. 

# Species Recorded
From May 2019 I visited a number of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust (BBOWT) nature reserves to photograph native UK speices. The following list records the BBOWT sites I visted, together with the species observed for a given time of year. I also took a field trip to the Picos de Europa, in northern Spain in early June. This area is renowned within Europe for a high density of Orchid species, and whilst many are similar to those which are native to the UK, there are a some that are not found in the UK.

Each species recorded in the sections below has the following information:

## Observation data
* Genus
* Species 
* Location - where I observed the species
* Dates seen - the time of year the observation was made
* Habitat - what habitat(s) the species was recorded in

## Other data
* Identification - what are the distinguishing features that allow identification
* Pollination - how is the plant typically pollinated (most as recorded in the field guide - see references)
* UK classification - what is the current conservation status of the species according to the *Vascular Plant Red Data List for Great Britain*
* UK distribution - where within the UK is the species typically found.
